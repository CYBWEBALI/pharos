This guide will help you learn about contributing code to Pharos.

Whether it's your first time contributing to Pharos or you're a seasoned veteran, review the contribution guidelines to decide where new components should live and how to bring them into being.

If you're just getting started, you might want to start by reading about [the code structure](./development/code-structure.md) and the [conventions and processes](./development/conventions/README.md) for this repository. If you're eager to get up and running, you may want to check out the [quick start guide](./development/quick-start.md).

Once you've familiarized yourself with the code base and have your machine set up for development, you can learn about [the anatomy of a component](./development/anatomy-of-a-component.md) and start building your own. You should also make sure to [test your work](./development/testing.md).

If you notice anything missing or incorrect while you're following this documentation, please let the maintainers know or open a pull request!
